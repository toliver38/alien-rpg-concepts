### Quantum Calibrator

- **Description:** With advancements in technology, quantum systems have found their way into many ship systems and gadgets. Technicians possessing the Quantum Calibrator talent have an innate understanding of these intricate systems.
  
- **Benefit:** When working on quantum-based systems or devices, the technician can re-roll any failed Comtech or Heavy Machinery checks once per task. This enables them to make adjustments on the fly based on quantum fluctuations and readouts that others might miss.

- **Restriction:** Can be used once per in-game day.

---

### Echo Locator

- **Description:** Technicians with this talent have developed a unique method to locate malfunctions. By sending out a range of frequencies and analyzing the echo, they can pinpoint issues that might be hidden to the naked eye or regular diagnostics.
     
- **Benefit:** When searching for hidden compartments, malfunctions, or electronic traps, the technician gains a bonus die to their roll. This can be invaluable in situations where a regular diagnostic might not catch an anomaly.
     
- **Restriction:** Requires the technician to have access to the ship or facility's main audio or communication system.
