**Benefit**
- When interacting with a digital system or network, the Techno-Shaman can attempt to discern insights by rolling an `Empathy + Mystic Tech` check.
- Success provides vague yet valuable insights related to the current situation or location. The Game Mother determines the specifics based on context.

- Success grants access or bypasses the security without triggering alarms or defensive countermeasures.
- A critical success might also grant insights or control over other connected systems.

- **Restrictions**
- Requires a genuine intent; if the Techno-Shaman has malicious intentions, the spirit might become hostile.
- The more advanced or complex the system, the harder it might be to persuade its spirit.
