# Lysandra "Lys" Korr

### Class
Arful Dodger

## Physical Description:

Lysandra stands at 5'7" with an athletic build, forged from years of evading corporate security and navigating dangerous terrains. Her hazel eyes are sharp and constantly assessing her surroundings. A mane of raven-black hair cascades down her back, often tied in a tight braid when on a mission. Scars, a testimony to her past skirmishes, lace her arms. Her attire is a blend of practicality and style - a fitted jacket made of materials that adjust to temperature and a pair of sturdy boots that have seen more planets than most. Around her neck hangs a pendant, a family heirloom, that she's never seen without.

### Overview: 

Born on a fringe colony, Lysandra was a child prodigy in deciphering old-world art and alien artifacts. However, her colony's location made it a hotspot for corporate exploitation. Weyland-Yutani, and other conglomerates, pillaged the art and treasures, relegating them to elite private collections and deep corporate vaults. To combat this, Lysandra became the Artful Dodger - smuggling treasures and artifacts to their rightful places or to those who'd protect them.

### Backstory:
Born on Eridani-4, a fringe colony nestled at the edge of a dying star, Lysandra's early life was one of hardship and wonder. Eridani-4 was renowned for its ruins - remnants of an ancient alien civilization. It was here, amidst age-old alien archways and forgotten temples, that young Lysandra developed her fascination with artifacts and art.

Her parents, both archaeologists, taught her to respect history and the stories buried within it. They'd spend days excavating, with Lysandra sketching and cataloging the finds. It was a simple, fulfilling life. However, the peace was short-lived. Weyland-Yutani Corp, upon learning of a potential "biological goldmine," claimed Eridani-4, bringing machinery and mercenaries.

In an excavation gone wrong, Lysandra's parents were killed, buried beneath the rubble of a temple they had dedicated their lives to studying. The corporation, in its relentless pursuit of profit, didn't even halt operations.

Orphaned, Lysandra was consumed by anger and sorrow. Adopted by an old art forger named Eledon, she learned the tricks of the trade, from replicating ancient scriptures to forging modern identification papers. She became the Artful Dodger, an identity crafted to safeguard the artifacts from corporate clutches and return them to their rightful places.

With each successful operation against Weyland-Yutani and other conglomerates, Lysandra's reputation grew. From the core systems to the outer rims, her name was whispered in hushed tones. Some saw her as a hero; to others, she was a thorn in the side of progress.

Yet, behind the mask of the Artful Dodger, Lysandra was on a personal quest: to find the artifact that her parents had died for and to discover its secrets, hoping it might hold the key to a past that was swiftly being forgotten.

### Creative Twist for the DM:

**The Eldritch Relic:** During her adventures, Lysandra stumbles upon an artifact rumored to hold ancient cosmic powers. The relic is said to have the potential to control or even repel the Xenomorph species. Lysandra, aware of the relic's significance and danger, keeps this information hidden from most. The relic becomes a central plot point, with various factions, including Weyland-Yutani, desiring it for their own agendas. Its true potential and how it interacts with the Xenomorphs can be a mystery the DM unravels throughout the campaign, offering a mix of horror, intrigue, and cosmic mystery.
