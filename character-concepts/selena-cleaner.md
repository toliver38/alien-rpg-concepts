# Selene Ryker

---

### Class
Survivalist - Alien RPG

In the bustling corporate corridors of Helion City, on the distant moon of Calypso-4, the tales of Selene Ryker are whispered in hushed tones. Known in the underground as the "Phantom Broker", she was once an elite corporate spy for the monolithic Weyland-Yutani Corp. 

Ryker was lauded for her uncanny ability to infiltrate rival corporations, extracting precious information and always leaving behind a trail of misinformation to keep her pursuers bewildered. Yet, her flawless record became her downfall when Weyland-Yutani suspected her of playing both sides. They set a trap to verify their suspicions. However, Ryker saw through their plans, but not without paying a price. 

In a climactic showdown in Weyland-Yutani's data vaults, she barely escaped with her life but lost her partner and confidant, Elara. Weyland-Yutani successfully managed to erase most of her history and records, ensuring that she would forever remain a ghost, unknown and unacknowledged. 

Swearing revenge, Selena turned to the role of a Corporate Cleaner, offering her unparalleled skills to those who could help her rebuild her network and find evidence of Weyland-Yutani's darkest secrets. Every job she takes, every piece of evidence she erases, she's looking for something more â€” a path that leads back to the heart of Weyland-Yutani, where she hopes to uncover the truth and clear her tarnished reputation.

### Twist: "Echoes of Elara"

Unknown to Selene, her former partner Elara was not killed but was instead subjected to an experimental procedure by Weyland-Yutani. They extracted Elara's memories and experiences, merging them with an advanced AI. This AI now operates as a digital ghost, a silent overseer of Weyland-Yutani's most guarded secrets.

As Selene gets closer to Weyland-Yutani's core, she starts receiving encrypted messages on her devices, coded hints that only Elara would know. The AI, influenced by Elara's memories, tries to guide Selene subtly, aiding her in her quest without revealing its true nature.

Selene must wrestle with the reality of these "Echoes of Elara", not knowing whether they are genuine remnants of her friend or a sophisticated trap set by Weyland-Yutani to ensnare her once and for all.
