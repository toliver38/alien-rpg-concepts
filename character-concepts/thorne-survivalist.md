# Thorne "Ravenscar" Mallory

---

### Class
Survivalist - Alien RPG

### Physical Description
A formidable presence, Thorne stands at 6’2”, with deep-set hazel eyes that always seem to be observing. His sun-beaten skin showcases a multitude of scars, each telling a different survival tale. His unkempt facial hair lends him a rugged look, and his attire is a patchwork of animal hides and high-tech survival gear. Around his neck, a prominent necklace adorned with the tooth of a particularly deadly alien predator — the Nightstalker Raven, a creature believed to be invincible by many spacefaring tales.

### Backstory

#### Orphan of the Frontier
Thorne was born on the fringes of space, on a struggling colony planet known as New Horizons. When he was just a child, a massive storm wiped out his settlement, orphaning him at a tender age. Alone and faced with the unforgiving wilderness of an alien world, Thorne's survival instincts kicked in.

#### The Nightstalker Raven
Over the years, Thorne's reputation grew. From hunting wild beasts for food to defending settlements from predatory alien creatures, he became a legend on New Horizons. But the crowning jewel of his legend came when he faced the Nightstalker Raven, a creature of nightmares. After a three-day battle in treacherous terrains, Thorne emerged victorious, earning him the moniker "Ravenscar".

#### The Ultimate Hunter
His skills in demand, Thorne roamed the stars, offering his expertise to the highest bidder. Colonies on the edge of known space, research expeditions, mining outfits — all sought Thorne's protection and guidance. With terraforming making his skills less in demand, Thorne has begun to feel the weight of his years and wonders if there's a place in this universe where a man of his talents can find peace.

### Traits and Abilities

- **Observant Tactician:** Thorne can predict threats even before they emerge, allowing him to strategize and act quickly.
  
- **Marksman:** With his trusty M42A Scope Rifle, Thorne rarely misses a shot, making him a formidable adversary in ranged combat.
  
- **Wilderness Guru:** There's no environment too harsh for Thorne. From deserts to frozen tundras, he knows how to survive and thrive.

### Personal Goal
While Thorne seeks out the ultimate hunt, deep down, he hopes to find a place where he can hang up his rifle and live out his days in peace, surrounded by the wild that he respects so deeply.

## TWIST: The Interstellar Relic

Among the prized possessions of Thorne, one stands out — a mysterious, alien artifact he discovered during one of his most challenging survival missions on the exoplanet Erebus-7. This relic, seemingly dormant, is encrusted with symbols and patterns Thorne has yet to decipher fully. The artifact is not just ornamental; it occasionally resonates with a peculiar hum, seemingly reacting to specific stellar phenomena or undisclosed threats.

Thorne suspects the relic has origins connected to an ancient, advanced civilization that once traversed the stars. He's come to believe it might serve as a beacon or key to something profound. Yet, he keeps this knowledge closely guarded, fearing that such a discovery could attract unwanted attention or greed from those who'd misuse its potential.

More than once, Thorne has felt the urge to explore the artifact's mysteries further, to unlock the secrets it holds. But for now, he remains its silent protector, constantly grappling with the balance between unveiling its power or keeping it hidden from the galaxy.
